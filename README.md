**Competitive analysis**

 Myntra is a top online fashion store in India that competes with AJIO, Amazon Fashion, Flipkart, and Tata Cliq.It is strong because of its well-known brand, special partnerships, a wide range of products, and an easy-to-use app with smart suggestions.However, it faces challenges like tough competition, pressure on prices, and dependence on big discounts.There are chances to grow its own brands, focus on sustainability, and use smart technology for personalization.But it also faces threats from new direct-to-consumer brands and changing customer preferences.
